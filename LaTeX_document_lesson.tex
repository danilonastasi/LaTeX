\begin{abstract}
    Biodiversity conservation faces a methodological conundrum: Biodiversity measurement often relies on species, most of which are rare at various scales, especially prone
to extinction under global change, but also the most challenging to sample and model.
Predicting the distribution change of rare species using conventional species distribution models is challenging because rare species are hardly captured by most survey
systems. When enough data are available, predictions are usually spatially biased towards locations where the species is most likely to occur, violating the assumptions of
many modelling frameworks. Workflows to predict and eventually map rare species
distributions imply important trade-­offs between data quantity, quality, representativeness and model complexity that need to be considered prior to survey and analysis.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Since the 1920s, \textcolor{red} {aerial photography} has represented an \tr{important data} source for the
detection of landscape patterns and their change over time.

\tr{Multitemporal analysis represents a powerful method for the study of all ecological and geological processes that change over time. The literature involves several fields of study: from soil loss to natural resources assessment to vegetation and ecological dynamics.}

\section{Study area}
The study area is the nature reserve of Poggio all’Olmo in Tuscany (Figure \ref{fig:brenta}), Italy (11 28 26E, 42 51 45N, WGS84 Datum). It is located on the side of Mt. Amiata,
comprising 440 ha, with elevations ranging from 650 to 1016 m above mean sea level (m.s.l.) and slopes from 0 to 55.

\section{Methods}
In this section I am going to describe the methods of this manuscript. First of all I will strat with the formulas used and then I will pass to the code!

They are basically divided into:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The formulas
    \item The code
\end{itemize}

Using numbers, they are basically divided into:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The formulas
    \item The code
\end{enumerate}

First of all I will start with the formulas used and then I will  pass to the code!

\subsection{Formulas}
Here is the formula used in this manuscript:

\begin{equation}
    F = G  \times \frac{m_{1} \times m_{2}}{d^2}
    \label{eq:newton}
\end{equation}

Let's make a more complex equation:
\begin{equation}
    F = \frac{\sqrt[3]{G \times \frac{m_{1} \times m_{2}}{d^{2 \times \mu}}}}{-\sum{p(x) \times \log{p(x)}}}
\end{equation}

Let's put a formula directly in the main text. We can apply this: $F=G \times m_{1}$.

\subsection{Code}
Here is the code used in this manuscript:

\section{Results}
As a result of this study I found that the Cadmium is present in the analyzed soil with a total amount of 15\%. These results were achieved according to Equation \ref{eq:newton}.
